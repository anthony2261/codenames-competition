client_run.py: run this file (using "python client_run.py") to participate in the TWIMLfest 2020 codenames competition
Dan Hilgart <dhilgart@gmail.com>

This file starts an async event loop and then adds a new task each X seconds to ping the server and get the current
    status for the player. If the server is waiting for this player, it will call
    TWIML_codenames_API_Client.query_and_respond() which in turn:
        asks the server for the necessary inputs
        calls the appropriate function from my_model.py
        sends the outputs from that function back to the server
